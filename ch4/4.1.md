# Data Transfer Instructions

## MOV
* operands must be same size
* both cannot be memory
* instruction pointers can't be dest


**zero extend**: fill the highest bits with zeroes/highest bit from source

## MOVZX: move with zero extend
* unsigned int only

## MOVSX: move with zero extend (signed)

# LAHF
* store storage bytes into AH (no operands)
* * sign, zero, auxiliary, parity, and carry.
## SAHF
* load storage bytes from AF

## XCHG
* swap two data from two operands
* no immediate operands
* for two memories, you need to use a temporary register

## Direct Off-set
`[val + *number*]`

example:

```
arrayB BYTE 10h,10h,30h,40,50h

mov al,[arrayB + (2 * offset)] ; third elemnt in array
```
* WORD has a 2 byte offset
* DWORD has a 4 byte offset

## Arithmetic
* `ADD` does not change the source operand.
* `NEG` reverts twos compliment, changing signs

# 4.3 Data-Related Operators and Directives
* `OFFSET`: distance from variable from beginning on enclosing segment
    * can be used in direct-offset in arrays i.e. ([array + (OFFSET myArray + 4))
    * can create pointer-like variables to arrays by loading a variable with the offset of another
* `PTR`: operand's default size overload
    * good for accessing size different from assumed (type-cast like)
    ````
    .data
    myouble DWORD 12345678h
    .code
    mov ax,WORD PTR myDouble ; casts myDouble to WORD to move 5678h to ax
    ````
    * can also access memory like this
    `mov ax,WORD PTR [myDouble + 2]; fetches 1234h`
    * can also move smaller values into larger destinations
    ```
    wordList WORD 5678h,1234h
    mov eax,DWORD PTR wordList ; EAX = 12345678h
    ````
* `TYPE`: size in bytes of operand or element in array
* `LENGTHOF`: number of elements in array
    * null character in strings count
* `SIZEOF` number of bytes used by an array initalizer
    * LENGTHOF * TYPE
* `ALIGN`: ALIGN next variable into next *bound* boundary
    * performance is better on even number bounds
* `LABEL`: a label to give a size attribute; allocs no storage

# 4.4 Indirect Addressing
* 32 bit register
* assumed to contain address
* [*register*] to dereference
* Some instructions require to know the size, so we "cast" it with `PTR`:

    ```
    inc BYTE PTR [esi]
    ```

# 4.4.2 Arrays
* Use indirect operands to step through aways, be wary of the array's type when incrementing index
* 4 bytes for doubleword, etc

# 4.4.3 Indexed Operand
* adds a constant to a register to generate an address
* any 32 bit register can be used
````
Notation:
    constant[reg]
    [constant + reg]
    example: array[edx]
````
* Indexes start at zero.

## Second version
* combines a register with a constant offset
* index register holds the base of array or struct, and constant is the offset of the elements
````
mov, esi,OFFSET array
mov ax,[esi + *n*]
````
* You can use 16bit registers to subscript, but you are limited to `SI`, `DI`, `BX` and `BP`.

# 4.4.4 Pointers
* contains the address of another variable

    Example
    ````
    .data
    arrayB byte 10h,2h,30h,40h
    ptrB DWORD arrayB; or ptrB dword OFFSET arrayB
    ````

# Typedef
* Like C, but syntax is different
* *syntax*: `*new type* TYPEDEF *to alias*`
* Great for pointers
* Placed before the .data segment

# 4.5 JMP and LOOP Instructors
* transfer of control

## Unconditional

Control is transfer to a new location

New address is loaded intro instruction pointer, causing execution at new address

`JMP` instruction
* Like `goto` in C
```
label:
    
jmp label
```

## Conditional

Branches if condition is true, true/false conditions based on ECX and Flags registers

### LOOP (Loop According to ECX Counter)

`LOOP destination`

* destination must be within -128 to +127 bytes of the current location counter.

Looping Steps:
1. Subtracts 1 to ECX
2. Check if ECX == 0
3. IF ECX == 0; jump to destination label
3. IF ECX != 0; go to the next instruction

* In real address mode, CX is the loop counter
* LOOPD uses ECX as loop counter
* LOOPW uses CX as loop counter

Nested loops: The outer loop should be saved in a variable and restored after the inner loop.
