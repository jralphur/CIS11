# Structures and Macros

## Structures
```
name STRUCT
    fields
name ENDS
```

* just like `struct` in C/C++
* performance: align depending on each data type
* on .data, align on largest data member

### Declaring Structures
`identifier structureType < initializer list > `

example: `point1 COORD <1, 2>`

When using esi as a pointer, make sure to cast it when deferencing with PTR
