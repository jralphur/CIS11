- [ ] Which assignment took you the longest to complete?
	The one about rotation of the array, simply because I put more code than needed for practice
- [ ] Which assignment was the most difficult?
	The rotation, but it wasn't very difficult, just had to use a pen and paper to visualize some array arithmetic
- [ ] Which assignment was the easiest?
	Assignment 10
- [ ] Of the concepts we covered, which (if any) are you the most confused about still?
	None
- [ ] If we had an extra week to spend on any of the concepts covered in this course, which one would it be?
	Translating high level code to low level code
- [ ] Were there any assignments you felt were unnecessarily tedious (not necessarily difficult, but that took too long to complete)
	Any of the non-programming assignments, as they mostly are just reciting what's in the book
- [ ] Which assignment was your favorite?
	The rotation one
- [ ] Which assignment do you think you learned the most from?
	Rotation as I took beyond than whats needed
- [ ] Were the assignment requirements and due dates clear enough?  If not, how so?
	Yes
- [ ] On a scale of 1-5, rate the difficulty (1=Breating, 5=Exiting Vim) of this course compared to other CIS courses you've taken.
	1
- [ ] Was the book used in this course effective/helpful?  Would you recommend a different one?
	I wish the book would go over practical programming ideas, philosophy, etc as this book felt like a beginner's reference guide
- [ ] Were there any topics that we didn't cover that you would have liked to see included?
	Different assembly languages `nasm`, etc
- [ ] How can this course be improved?
	Take less time on setting the programming environment
	Have the template project to be customized for this class.
		I don't know if you can edit and save the layout of a visual studio environment into a project, but if you can, I think you would want the layout
		to show CPU flags, memory, etc etc

	More programming assignments
	Use a different assembly language (does the school even allow this?) I use a Linux laptop and I can't use masm on Linux because Microsoft likes to be an asshole
